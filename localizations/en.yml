    hello_message: You are starting a difficult journey and I'm your story teller. Now you're standing in the middle of a corridor - the center of our game. It has lots of doors and every turn you will open one of them. Is there a way out of this hell? I don't even know, but we can check. Be careful, behind the door might be a dungeon with a dragon, but also a lake of ice cream. Take dice, you need to throw them on any action requiring the luck and skills. If you're lucky a monster will fall. But if not... Well... You'll be embarressed before your enemy and they'll take pity on you. We have a shrine. If you'll pray to one God three times you can get something good. But it's better to not mix up. Our telegram group where you can find people like you @robotgroup You might experience some lag because of user influx :(
