    hello_message: You are starting a difficult journey and I'm your story teller. Now you're standing in the middle of a corridor—the center of our game. It has lots of doors and on every turn you will open one of them. Is there a way out of this hell? I don't even know, frankly, but we can find out. Be careful, behind a door there might be a dragon-guarded dungeon, but it might as well be a lake of ice cream. Take these dice, you'll need to roll them whenever an action requires luck or skill. If you're lucky, a monster will fall. But if not... Well... your foes might take pity on you if you're pathetic enough. We also have a shrine. If you pray to the same god several times in a row, you can get something fancy in return. But you better don't mix. @robotgroup is our Telegram group where you can find people just like you. You might experience some lag because of user influx :(
